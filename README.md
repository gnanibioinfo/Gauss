# Gauss
R Shiny application that automates the extraction and computation of key electronic properties from Gaussian log files, including HOMO, LUMO, energy gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, electrochemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity. 

To utilize this script, download the necessary files and create a dedicated folder on your desktop. Place the downloaded files within this folder, then open Gauss.R by double-clicking on it. This will launch RStudio. In the top-right corner of RStudio, click on RunApp to initiate the application.

Once the application is running, users can upload a Gaussian log file. Upon successful upload, the application will extract and display key molecular parameters, including HOMO, LUMO, energy gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, electrochemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity, in a structured tabular format.
