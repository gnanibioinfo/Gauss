# Gauss
R Shiny application that automates the extraction and computation of key electronic properties from Gaussian log files, including HOMO, LUMO, energy gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, electrochemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity. 

Before opening Gauss.R, it is necessary to download and install R and RStudio. Afterward, you must install the shiny library in R by running the following command:
install.packages("shiny")

Once this is done, you can proceed to open Gauss.R by double-clicking on it within the folder. This will launch RStudio. In the top-right corner of RStudio, click RunApp to start the application.

To use this, download the repository and extract it to a dedicated folder on your desktop. Inside this folder, double-click on Gauss.R to open it. This will launch RStudio. In the top-right corner of RStudio, click RunApp to start the application.

Once the application is running, users can upload a Gaussian log file. Upon successful upload, the application will extract and display key molecular parameters, including HOMO, LUMO, energy gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, electrochemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity, in a structured tabular format.
